(name 'Widgets-mt.261'message 'BIG UPDATE (not finished yet)---* way to write models for item views changed fundamentally* traits can be implemented to re-use present data structures as model (TUiItemModel, TUiItemDelegate)* traditional way still possible via UiSimpleItemModel subclassing! UiModelIndex only for internal usage now! model index unboxing not yet implemented (i.e., selection in view still provides model indices; use property #node to access data item)! UiItemModelFinder still needs model indices (will change)! Some deprecated classes will be removed soon (see package "Widgets-Views-Deprecated")'id '7e1cf109-38f9-3c46-9de9-dfb0fdee57a7'date '13 January 2012'time '11:20:55.843 am'author 'mt'ancestors ((id '5c38a9b9-6474-ac4b-9bf9-7be1c22efa43'))stepChildren ())
