UiDesigner
===================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hpi-swa-teaching/UiDesigner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hpi-swa-teaching/UiDesigner)

The Morphic Designer is an application to create Morphic user interfaces with ease. It follows basic ideas of the QtDesigner from the Nokia Qt Framework.

New user interfaces are created via simple drag&drop operations and do not involve writing much source code explicitely. A code generator creates valid Smalltalk code for your design. Designs can be loaded and modified at any time. Even some manual modifications of the generated code are possible, as the load process just executes that code and instantiates the design.

Several people already worked with the designer and created reviews, blogposts, and screencasts.

Contributing
============
As of July 2014, the student project that contributed significantly to the development of this project has ended.
During our development, we employed the Extreme Programming (XP) process. We mapped GitHub's issues to User Stories,
and left off the following User Stories (Issues) started, but unfinished: #53 and #57

If you want to complete these, you will find more information on the respective issue.

Do not get irritated from the fact that Travis shows our build as failing. It has severe problems executing our tests
and our priorities were different from fixing Travis. Locally, all our tests pass ;)
