The Morphic Designer is an application to create Morphic user interfaces with ease. It follows basic ideas of the QtDesigner from the â€‹Nokia Qt Framework.

New user interfaces are created via simple drag&drop operations and do not involve writing much source code explicitely. A code generator creates valid Smalltalk code for your design. Designs can be loaded and modified at any time. Even some manual modifications of the generated code are possible, as the load process just executes that code and instantiates the design.

Several people already worked with the designer and created reviews, blogposts, and screencasts.
